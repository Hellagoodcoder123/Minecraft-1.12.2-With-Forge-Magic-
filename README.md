# Minecraft-1.12.2-With-Forge-Magic-
Modpack designed by player Eth0_0, designed to be played by him and SamOBamO.
Has over 200 mods, almost all of them are magic based.
Includes mods such as Thaumcraft (and a lot of addons for it), Electroblob's Wizardry (also a lot of addons for it), and more.
Some files are written as a txt and will have the original file name before the ".txt", in this case, follow the instructions in the txt file and download the required version of the needed item.
Configs should not be edited and are specifically made to fit exactly to the needs of the pack.

After downloading, make sure to change the name of the folder "mixin.out" to ".mixin.out" because otherwise minecraft cannot process it. Github cannot process 'hidden files', which are files with a "." in front of them.
